# MW3 Native Controller Support (Campaign & Survival)

**Status: PRE-ALPHA — actively in development (as of 2026-07-16).** Analog movement, look,
and most buttons are confirmed working live against `iw5sp.exe` (Campaign/Survival),
including a real sprint stamina/cooldown model, Start's full pause/unpause, weapon
switching, D-pad killstreak/attachment slots, and Survival's between-wave ready-up. Back
is still unassigned (deprioritized — not gameplay-defining), killstreaks need
per-killstreak work, sprint's mission/perk overrides (unlimited-sprint missions, Extreme
Conditioning) aren't accounted for yet, full menu/UI navigation isn't implemented, and
Multiplayer (`iw5mp.exe`) hasn't been started. Not feature-complete, not fully tested
end-to-end.

A from-scratch native controller mod for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (2011, IW5
engine) — analog movement, look, and buttons driven directly through the game's own
engine calls, not keyboard/mouse emulation. See `re_notes/` for the full reverse-
engineering writeup this mod is built on, and `PATCHNOTES.md` for what changed in
each release.

## Feature list

### Movement & look
- **Analog movement** (move-stick, left by default) — real `usercmd_t.forwardmove`/
  `.rightmove` bytes, additive on top of any keyboard input already present.
- **Analog look** (look-stick, right by default) — writes the raw pitch/yaw
  angle-delta accumulators directly, bypassing the mouse pipeline entirely (own
  sensitivity, no mouse accel/filter inherited). Sensitivity, invert-Y, and an
  ADS-zoom-aware slowdown curve are all configurable — see **Configuration** below.
- **ADS look-slowdown** — look rate scales down while aiming, proportional to the
  weapon's actual live zoom level (`effectiveFov/hipfireFov`, read-only — your real
  field of view is never touched), so magnified optics don't feel absurdly twitchy.
  A separate baseline multiplier applies some slowdown even on low-zoom optics (iron
  sights/red dots), where the zoom ratio alone stays too close to 1.0 to produce a
  noticeable effect on its own. Both configurable, mathematically safe at any value
  (a power curve, not a linear blend — the linear version could invert look direction
  at high strength on deep zooms; fixed in v0.1.1).

### Combat & interaction
- **Fire** (RT), **Tactical**/**Lethal** (LB/RB), **Jump** (A).
- **ADS** (LT) — true hold-to-aim via the real `+toggleads_throw` `kbutton_t`
  KeyDown/KeyUp calls, not a toggle or a raw bit.
- **Melee** (R3) — real melee kbutton, confirmed "100% knife" live.
- **Reload** (X) — real, context-sensitive `kbutton_t`, found via memdiff; fires
  instantly on press, unaffected by Interact's hold requirement below.
- **Interact** (X, same physical button as Reload) — **requires a hold** (300ms by
  default, configurable), not an instant tap: a quick tap reloads the weapon instead,
  same as console. Reload is a separate real kbutton on the same physical button that
  fires on every press regardless of hold duration — so a quick tap doesn't fire
  Interact, but does trigger a real reload.
- **Weapon switch** (Y) — real `weapnext` dispatch via the engine's own bind-index
  jump table, found by live-reading the raw-keycode dispatch table for the actual
  bound keys.
- **D-pad** (all 4 directions) — real `+actionslot 1-4` dispatch, data-driven by
  loadout (killstreaks/attachments/NVG-style toggles, whatever's actually equipped).
  Up/Right/Down call the real dispatch function directly; Left is the second of this
  mod's two deliberate, documented exceptions to native-only input (see below) — it
  synthesizes the real bound key instead, since Survival's AI-squadmate call-in on
  that slot needed it (turret call-ins on the same slot are unaffected).

### Stance & Sprint (real engine state, not our own tracked copy)
- **Crouch/Prone stance ladder** (B) — a real 3-state ladder driving the game's own
  native togglecrouch/toggleprone toggle directly (not a raw bit force), so it can
  never desync from the engine's own state:

  | Current stance | B tapped | B held |
  |---|---|---|
  | Standing | → Crouched | → Prone |
  | Crouched | → Standing | → Prone |
  | Prone | → Crouched | → Standing |

  "Hold" fires the instant the press crosses the threshold (no need to release
  first); "tap" only fires on release, and only if the hold threshold was never
  reached during that press. Threshold is configurable (400ms default).
- **Sprint** (L3) — real `pm_flags` bit, forced via a Pmove-entry hook; auto-stands
  from crouch/prone first if needed, matching console. Includes a real
  **stamina/cooldown state machine** (our own timer layer, since forcing the bit
  natively bypasses the game's own limiter entirely):

  | State | Behavior | Transitions to |
  |---|---|---|
  | Ready | Full stamina, sprint available | Sprinting (on L3 held) |
  | Sprinting | Stamina drains continuously | Winded (stamina hits 0), Regenerating (L3 released early) |
  | Winded | Sprint fully blocked for a fixed cooldown, independent of stamina float | Ready (cooldown timer expires, full refill) |
  | Regenerating | Stamina refills while not sprinting | Ready (full) or Sprinting (L3 held again) |

  4 seconds of continuous sprint to fully deplete, a real 2-second cooldown once
  winded (both configurable) — not just a cosmetic meter, sprint is genuinely
  blocked while on cooldown, decoupled from the stamina float itself (an earlier
  version had a regen-flicker bug where continuous regen cleared the cooldown lock
  almost instantly; fixed with a dedicated cooldown timer). Automatically bypassed
  (genuinely unlimited sprint) when the real `player_sprintUnlimited` dvar is
  live-set by specific missions. Real keyboard Shift-to-sprint is left completely
  untouched by these hooks, regardless of whether a controller is connected or idle
  (see Known Limitations for the k+m note, and Sprint's real kbutton search).

### Menu & pause
- **Start button** — opens **and closes** the pause menu via real engine calls (not a
  keypress emulation): the real hardcoded ESCAPE-key path for opening, and the same
  function's real "resume" case for closing, driven by a `WndProc` subclass hook so it
  keeps working even while the game's gameplay-simulation tick halts during pause.
- **B — back out of menus** — while a menu is open (main menu, pause menu, etc.), B
  forwards a real ESC keypress to it (the same real mechanism the engine's own key
  handler uses for ESC generically), backing out one level or closing it, on top of
  its normal crouch/prone role during gameplay.
- **Survival ready-up** (hold Y ~740ms between waves) — one of two deliberate, documented
  exceptions to this mod's native-only approach (see below); switches weapons instead if
  released before the threshold.
- **Buy-station + pause interaction fix** — a real native bug (not ours) where using a
  buy station then pausing could permanently break all input (ours and real
  keyboard/mouse) until level reload; fixed by reinstating a rising-edge gate window.

### Configuration & customization

All of the tunable values above — plus button/stick layout — live in
**`mw3ncp_config.ini`**, written next to the DLL the first time the mod runs (with
every option pre-filled with its default value and a comment explaining it, so the
file is self-documenting from the moment it appears — nothing to configure by hand
to get started). Changes take effect on next launch; there's no live-reload yet, and
no in-game options screen — this file is the interim way to tune the mod until
native controller UI navigation exists.

| Section | Key | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[Look]` | `Sensitivity` | `250` | Look-stick turn rate, degrees/second at full deflection (not always the right stick — depends on `StickLayout` below) |
| `[Look]` | `AdsSlowdownStrength` | `1.75` | ADS zoom-aware look slowdown strength (`0` = off, `1` = fully proportional to zoom, higher = more aggressive than proportional; `1.75` confirmed live to feel closer to real console controller CoD than exactly `1.0`) |
| `[Look]` | `AdsSlowdownBaseline` | `0.65` | Multiplies on top of the strength curve above — without it, low-zoom optics (iron sights/red dots) got almost no slowdown at all, since the zoom ratio alone stays too close to `1.0` to produce a real effect regardless of strength. `1.0` = no extra effect; lower = more slowdown even at minimal zoom |
| `[Look]` | `InvertLook` | `0` | OG console "Invert Look" — flips vertical look |
| `[Stance]` | `ProneHoldThresholdMs` | `400` | B: hold-vs-tap threshold for the stance ladder |
| `[Interact]` | `HoldThresholdMs` | `300` | X: how long Interact must be held before it fires (a quick tap reloads instead, same as console) |
| `[Survival]` | `ReadyUpHoldThresholdMs` | `740` | Y: hold-to-ready-up threshold between Survival waves |
| `[Sprint]` | `MaxStaminaSeconds` | `4` | Seconds of continuous sprint before stamina depletes |
| `[Sprint]` | `RegenSeconds` | `2` | Seconds not sprinting to fully recover from empty |
| `[Bindings]` | `ButtonLayout` | `Default` | `Default` / `Tactical` / `Lefty` / `TacticalLefty` — see table below |
| `[Bindings]` | `StickLayout` | `Default` | `Default` / `Southpaw` / `Legacy` / `LegacySouthpaw` — see table below |
| `[Bindings]` | `FlipTriggers` | `0` | Independently swaps RT↔RB and LT↔LB, combining with whichever `ButtonLayout` is active |

**Button layout presets** (reconstructed from the unchanged CoD4→MW2→MW3 console
control scheme; ~90-95% confidence, not independently verified against real
hardware — `TacticalLefty` in particular may need a correction pass):

| Action | Default | Tactical | Lefty | TacticalLefty |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fire | RT | RT | LT | LT |
| ADS | LT | LT | RT | RT |
| Lethal | RB | RB | LB | LB |
| Tactical | LB | LB | RB | RB |
| Crouch/Prone | B | RS | B | LS |
| Sprint | LS | LS | RS | RS |
| Melee | RS | B | LS | B |

**Stick layout presets:**

| Layout | Left stick | Right stick |
|---|---|---|
| Default | Move | Look |
| Southpaw | Look | Move |
| Legacy | Forward/back + turn (horizontal) | Look up/down + strafe (horizontal) |
| LegacySouthpaw | Look up/down + strafe (horizontal) | Forward/back + turn (horizontal) |

## Why native, not an emulator

Every other "controller support" option for this game works by faking keyboard/mouse
input (synthetic key taps, injected mouse deltas) underneath a mapper tool. That adds a
real, measurable translation layer between the stick and the game: poll → convert to a
key/mouse event → OS input queue → the game's own keyboard/mouse-delta processing.

This mod instead writes straight into the engine's real per-frame input path —
`usercmd_t.forwardmove/rightmove`/`.buttons`, the raw pitch/yaw angle accumulators, and
(where the engine requires it) the real internal `kbutton_t` down/up state and
`pm_flags` bits the game's own movement code reads — from inside the game's own
process, on the game's own frame tick. There is no OS-level input event, no
intermediate queue, and no keyboard/mouse pipeline to pass through at all. That's a full
layer of translation and buffering removed, which is the mod's core advantage: input
feel and latency that matches (not approximates) native console analog input, not a
keyboard/mouse emulation layer with a controller icon on it.

**One narrow, explicit exception:** Survival's between-wave ready-up (hold Y) synthesizes
a real F5 keypress via `PostMessage` rather than driving an engine call directly. This is
a deliberate, user-approved workaround for one specific, non-gameplay-critical UI prompt
after an extensive multi-session search found no locatable native trigger — see
`re_notes/known_issues.md` issue #5 for the full trail and rationale. It's the only place
in the whole mod that does this; every other button, including all of movement/look/
combat, drives the engine's real internal state directly, as described above.

## Current control map (`iw5sp.exe`, Xbox-layout controller)

| Input | Action | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Left stick | Move (analog forward/back/strafe) | ✅ Confirmed |
| Right stick | Look (independent sensitivity, no mouse-accel/filter inherited) | ✅ Confirmed |
| Right trigger (RT) | Fire | ✅ Confirmed |
| Left trigger (LT) | Aim Down Sights (true hold-to-aim, real kbutton) | ✅ Confirmed |
| Left stick click (L3) | Sprint (real `pm_flags` bit; auto-stands from crouch/prone; real 4s/2s stamina-cooldown model) | ✅ Confirmed |
| A | Jump | ✅ Confirmed |
| B | Crouch/Prone — tap toggles crouch, hold goes prone, full 3-state ladder (see below) | ✅ Confirmed |
| X | Interact **and** Reload (real kbutton, context-sensitive like console) | ✅ Confirmed |
| Right stick click (R3) | Melee | ✅ Confirmed |
| Left bumper (LB) | Tactical (smoke) | ✅ Confirmed |
| Right bumper (RB) | Lethal (frag) | ✅ Confirmed |
| Y | Weapon switch (`weapnext`); hold ~740ms in Survival to ready up between waves | ✅ Confirmed |
| Start | Opens **and closes** the pause menu (real native calls, not a keypress emulation) | ✅ Confirmed |
| Back | *(unassigned)* | ⬜ Not yet implemented — a first attempt regressed live (see `re_notes/known_issues.md`), reverted, deprioritized (nice-to-have, not gameplay-defining) |
| D-pad (Up/Right/Down/Left) | `+actionslot 1-4` — killstreaks/attachments (e.g. noob tube), data-driven by loadout | ✅ Confirmed* (user tested at least half the directions live; all four use the identical confirmed mechanism, so high confidence on the untested ones too) |
| Killstreaks (collectively) | Calling in / controlling killstreaks (Predator missile, etc.) — see the dedicated table below | 🟡 Partial — essential to Campaign, which is otherwise mostly untested so far |
| Menu/UI navigation | Buy stations, pause menu, options, etc. | ⬜ Not yet implemented — mouse/keyboard still required |

**B's stance ladder**, matching real Xbox 360 CoD behavior (not a raw hold of either
bit):

| From | Tap | Hold |
|---|---|---|
| Standing | → Crouched | → Prone |
| Crouched | → Standing | → Prone |
| Prone | → Crouched | → Standing |

"Hold" fires the instant the press crosses the threshold; "tap" only fires on release,
and only if the hold threshold was never reached.

**Killstreaks** — essential to Campaign, which is otherwise mostly untested so far
(most testing to date has been Survival-focused):

| Killstreak | Status |
|---|---|
| Predator missile | 🟡 Partial — confirmed partially working live; needs its own per-killstreak investigation (see `re_notes/known_issues.md`) |
| All others | ⬜ Not yet tested |

## What's blocking the remaining buttons

- **Back:** a first attempt wired `0x00A98B14` in as `+scores`'s kbutton, based on an
  unvalidated assumption (a bind-name-table index treated as if it were a
  `FUN_00438710` switch case number). Confirmed WRONG live — it made the player walk
  backward (it's almost certainly the real `+back` movement kbutton). Reverted
  immediately; Back is a no-op again. Needs the same live-keycode-table technique that
  correctly solved weapnext (see `re_notes/known_issues.md`) applied to TAB instead.
  Deprioritized — scoreboard isn't gameplay-defining, unlike D-pad/killstreaks.
- **Killstreaks:** user's first live test (Predator missile) showed partial
  functionality — needs its own per-killstreak investigation once D-pad/scoreboard
  settle, likely a distinct mechanism per killstreak type.
- **Full menu/UI navigation:** a genuinely separate system from in-game movement/look
  (menus read keyboard/mouse binds, not `usercmd`). Deliberately saved for last per the
  project's locked scope order — needs its own hook/input-synthesis path plus
  button-glyph prompt swapping.

## Architecture

```
iw5sp.exe (unmodified game logic)
    │  loads d3d9.dll from its own directory first (standard Windows DLL search order)
    ▼
our proxy d3d9.dll                         ← real injection point, ships beside the exe
    │  forwards all real d3d9 exports to the genuine system d3d9.dll
    │  hooks IDirect3D9::CreateDevice (vtable) -> subclasses the real device's window
    ▼
XInput poll (linked by us, game has none)  → deadzone + response curve
    ▼
TWO separate per-frame injection points, because they run at different times:
    │  FUN_0057de60 (gameplay-simulation tick, halts while paused)
    │      — movement, look, buttons, ADS, Sprint, Reload, weapon switch inject here
    │  WndProc subclass + a SetTimer-driven ~60Hz WM_TIMER (keeps running even while
    │  paused, since it's a plain Win32 window hook, not a D3D9 vtable)
    │      — Start's pause-menu open/close inject here (a real Present hook was tried
    │        first but confirmed dead — see re_notes/known_issues.md)
    ▼
real KeyDown/KeyUp kbutton calls — ADS, Reload (not raw usercmd bits)
real Cbuf_AddText/Cmd_ExecuteString pair — confirmed working, but not the mechanism
    for weapnext/togglemenu (see re_notes/known_issues.md)
real hardcoded ESCAPE-key path + FUN_004396d0's open/close cases — Start's pause menu
real FUN_00541020 raw-keycode dispatch table + FUN_00438710 jump table — weapon switch
    and D-pad (+actionslot 1-4, data-driven by loadout: killstreaks/attachments/NVG)
synthetic keydown/keyup via PostMessage — Survival ready-up (F5) and D-pad Left's
    AI-squadmate call-in ('4') ONLY, the two deliberate exceptions to real-engine-
    calls-only input in this mod; real native triggers not yet found for either
our own timer layer (GetTickCount-based, independent per hook site) — sprint stamina/
    cooldown, since forcing the real pm_flags bit bypasses the native limiter entirely;
    bypassed itself when the real player_sprintUnlimited dvar is live-set by a mission
    ▼
separate hook/path still needed for FULL menu & UI navigation (not implemented yet)
```

Every hook target is found via byte-pattern/signature scanning or live memory-diffing
at runtime — never a hardcoded address assumed stable across game updates or even
between two launches of the same build (several of this mod's real kbutton/flag
addresses live in dynamically-allocated per-tick structures, not fixed static memory).
See `re_notes/iw5sp.md` for the complete reverse-engineering log: every function found,
every dead end ruled out, and why.

## Known limitations

See `re_notes/known_issues.md` for the full, actively-tracked list.

- Controller menu/UI navigation (D-pad/stick item selection, button-glyph prompts, a
  real controller options screen) is not implemented yet — for now, menus (buy
  stations, pause, etc.) still need mouse/keyboard, and that continues to work
  normally alongside controller gameplay.
- Survival ready-up (hold Y) uses a synthetic F5 keypress rather than a real engine
  call — the only such exception in the whole mod. The real native trigger was never
  found despite an extensive search (see `re_notes/known_issues.md` issue #5); this
  workaround will be replaced if/when one turns up.
- Sprint's stamina/cooldown model doesn't yet account for two real overrides: specific
  missions that live-set `player_sprintUnlimited` (checked and bypassed correctly) is
  handled, but the Extreme Conditioning perk (doubles sprint duration to 8s) is likely a
  separate mechanism (`perk_sprintMultiplier`) and isn't detected yet — see
  `re_notes/known_issues.md`.
- Full console-style aim assist (rotational friction, target magnetism) is not yet
  implemented — that requires reading live entity/aim-target data out of the game's
  process memory, planned as a later layer on top of the current stick response curves.
- Multiplayer (`iw5mp.exe`) support has not been started. It's a separately-built binary
  from `iw5sp.exe` — none of the offsets/addresses found so far carry over, and it needs
  its own full signature-scanning pass. There's also an open, unresolved question about
  anti-cheat exposure from code injection on `iw5mp.exe` that needs to be discussed
  before that work begins.
- **Keyboard/mouse play is intended to be strictly additive and unaffected, but is no
  longer treated as a fully-verified, first-class input path.** A real regression was
  found and fixed this session (our own controller-support hooks silently broke native
  keyboard sprint entirely — see `re_notes/known_issues.md` issue #10) — the kind of bug
  that's easy to introduce with this project's hooking style and easy to miss unless
  someone happens to test keyboard specifically. Controller is the actively-verified,
  primary input method going forward; if you're mainly a keyboard/mouse player, keep a
  keyboard within reach and expect the occasional oddity while this mod is installed.
  **This is not a suggestion to avoid the keyboard, though** — it's still required,
  not optional, for full menu/UI navigation, Back, and most killstreak call-ins, none
  of which have a controller-native implementation yet. A keyboard needs to stay
  reachable during any session either way. See `re_notes/known_issues.md` issue #11
  for the full reasoning.
