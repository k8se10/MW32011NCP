## v0.1.2 (2026-07-16)

Mostly a documentation-accuracy release: several features already present since
v0.1.1 (or earlier) had never been written up in the README or a changelog at all,
and a proofread pass against the actual source found real inaccuracies in the ones
that were. Small functional fix included (INI comment text only — no behavior
change).

### Newly documented (already shipped, not previously covered anywhere)
- **`mw3ncp_config.ini`** — self-generating configuration file, written next to the
  DLL the first time the mod runs, with every option pre-filled at its default value
  and a comment explaining it. Covers `[Look]` (sensitivity, ADS slowdown strength,
  invert look), `[Stance]` (B hold-vs-tap threshold), `[Interact]` (hold threshold),
  `[Survival]` (ready-up hold threshold), `[Sprint]` (stamina/regen seconds), and
  `[Bindings]` (button layout, stick layout, trigger flip). No live-reload yet —
  changes take effect on next launch. See README's **Configuration & customization**
  section for the full key reference.
- **Button layout presets** — `Default` / `Tactical` / `Lefty` / `TacticalLefty`,
  reconstructed from the unchanged CoD4→MW2→MW3 console control scheme (not
  independently verified against real hardware yet — `TacticalLefty` in particular
  may need a correction pass; see README for the full per-preset table).
- **Stick layout presets** — `Default` / `Southpaw` / `Legacy` / `LegacySouthpaw`.
  `Legacy` swaps only the horizontal axes between sticks (left stick keeps
  forward/back but turns instead of strafing; right stick keeps look up/down but
  strafes instead of turning) — the historical CoD4-era scheme, not a full stick
  swap.
- **`FlipTriggers`** — an independent toggle that swaps RT↔RB and LT↔LB, layered on
  top of whichever button layout is active.
- **Invert Look** — the OG console option, flips vertical look.
- **Interact (X) requires a hold, not an instant tap** (task #11) — a press released
  before the threshold (740ms default, configurable) simply does nothing; Reload (a
  separate real kbutton on the same physical button) is completely unaffected and
  still fires instantly. This was already implemented but wasn't reflected in the
  task list or any doc until now.
- **ADS look-slowdown fix and the Crouch/Prone real-toggle rewrite** (see v0.1.1's
  own entry below for what these actually fixed) are now covered by full mechanic
  tables in README (the stance ladder's tap/hold-per-state table, and Sprint's
  ready/sprinting/winded/regenerating state machine) — neither had a full
  state-transition writeup anywhere before this pass.

### Fixed
- **Three inaccurate setting descriptions**, found during the proofread pass above,
  corrected in both `mw3ncp_config.ini`'s self-generated comments
  (`mod_config.cpp`'s `WriteDefaultConfig`) and the matching README prose:
  - `[Look] Sensitivity` was described as "right-stick" unconditionally — it's
    actually whichever stick `StickLayout` currently routes to look, not always the
    right stick.
  - `[Stance] ProneHoldThresholdMs` described "hold" as simply "go prone," which is
    wrong for the Prone→hold transition specifically (that one stands you back up,
    the reverse). Corrected to describe the full 3-state ladder.
  - `[Interact] HoldThresholdMs` incorrectly claimed a quick tap "switches weapons
    instead" — that's Y/ready-up's behavior, not Interact's. A quick Interact tap
    does nothing; Reload (separate, same physical button) is unaffected either way.
  - Rebuilt `d3d9.dll` so the corrected INI comments actually ship (no other
    behavior change in this build vs. v0.1.1).

## v0.1.1 (2026-07-16)

### Fixed
- **Keyboard/mouse sprint regression.** The controller Sprint hooks
  (`InjectControllerSprintPmFlags`/`ReassertSprintPmFlags`) are wired directly into a
  real per-tick engine entry point and ran unconditionally — with no controller
  engaging sprint, they unconditionally cleared the real `pm_flags` sprint bit every
  tick, silently breaking vanilla keyboard Shift-to-sprint regardless of whether a
  controller was plugged in at all (a fully-unplugged controller, or one connected
  but idle, both triggered it). Fixed with bit-ownership tracking: the hooks now only
  ever clear a bit they set themselves, leaving real keyboard/native input completely
  untouched otherwise.
- **ADS look-slowdown could invert look direction on deep zooms.** The slowdown
  formula was a linear blend (`1 - strength*(1-ratio)`) that went negative — inverting
  look — for any configured strength above 1.0 once the zoom ratio dropped low enough
  (a real ACOG-level zoom, not an edge case). Not a native engine bug, not FPU
  corruption (both theories investigated and ruled out via diagnostic logging) — just
  the formula's own shape. Fixed by switching to a power curve (`ratio^strength`),
  which can never go negative for any non-negative strength while still allowing a
  stronger-than-proportional slowdown at high strength values.
- **Crouch/Prone rewired to the real native togglecrouch/toggleprone toggle**,
  replacing the mod's own tracked stance state and per-frame bit-forcing. Fixes a real
  stuck-prone bug (a Campaign session neither B nor Sprint could recover from stance
  lock, but real keyboard Ctrl could) and, as a side effect, a separate game-breaking
  bug where using the Predator missile killstreak while prone left the player
  permanently stuck prone. The stance ladder's user-facing behavior (tap/hold →
  crouch/prone, see README) is unchanged — only the underlying implementation, which
  no longer has a separate copy of stance state that can desync from the engine's own.

### Added
- **B backs out of menus like ESC.** B now forwards a real ESC keypress
  (`FUN_004d9850`) to whatever menu is currently active — the same real mechanism the
  engine's own key handler uses for ESC generically, not something pause-specific —
  so B backs out one level in the main menu, closes the pause menu (same as Start),
  or exits any other open menu. Hardcoded to physical B regardless of button-layout
  preset.
- **106 controller button-glyph icons extracted** (`assets/button_glyphs/`) covering
  Xbox 360, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS3, PS4, PS5, D-pad/stick-direction
  indicators, and shared/extra buttons — source art groundwork for native
  controller-glyph button prompts. **Not yet wired into any rendering code** — this
  is asset preparation only; see `re_notes/ui_assets.md` for the two remaining
  pieces of implementation work (a bind-text-resolver hook, and getting the art into
  a font the game will actually render) and one known outstanding polish issue (a
  faint stray text fragment in a couple of PS4 icons).
- **`tools/memdiff` gained a `poke` mode** (write-test a candidate memory address's
  behavioral effect live, with a configurable lead-in countdown) and a `rangewatch`
  mode (live-correlate a real key/button against one fixed, already-known-real
  address range instead of the whole process heap) — dev-only diagnostic tooling,
  not shipped as part of the mod itself. Rebuilt as x64 (was x86, which started
  hitting its own ~2GB address-space ceiling once heap-scan caps were widened).

### Changed
- **Keyboard/mouse deprioritized as a primary input path, not removed.** A direct
  consequence of the regression above: keyboard/mouse remains functionally required
  for menu navigation, Back, and most killstreak call-ins (none of which are
  controller-native yet), but is no longer verified to the same live-reproduction
  bar controller features get going forward. Controller is the primary,
  actively-verified input method with this mod installed. See
  `re_notes/known_issues.md` issues #10-#11.

### Investigated, not resolved
- **Sprint's real `+breath_sprint` kbutton — parked.** Three independent techniques
  (whole-process heap correlation, live write-testing the strongest candidates, and
  a targeted scan restricted to the confirmed-real kbutton neighborhood used by
  ADS/Reload) all came back negative. Controller Sprint keeps its existing
  `pm_flags`-forcing implementation. Full trail in `re_notes/iw5sp.md`.

## v0.1.0-prealpha (2026-07-15)

Initial pre-alpha release. Analog movement, look, and most buttons confirmed working
live against `iw5sp.exe` (Campaign/Survival):

- Analog movement (left stick) and look (right stick), both driven through real
  engine calls, not mouse/keyboard emulation.
- Fire (RT), ADS (LT, true hold via real `kbutton_t` calls), Melee (R3),
  Tactical/Lethal (LB/RB), Jump (A).
- Crouch/Prone stance ladder (B) — tap toggles crouch, hold goes prone.
- Interact + Reload (X) — real, context-sensitive `kbutton_t`.
- Sprint (L3) — real `pm_flags` bit, auto-stands from crouch/prone first, with a
  real stamina/cooldown model (4s sprint, 2s cooldown), correctly bypassed during
  missions that live-set `player_sprintUnlimited`.
- Weapon switch (Y) — real `weapnext` dispatch.
- Start — opens and closes the pause menu via real engine calls, working even while
  the game's own gameplay-simulation tick halts during pause.
- D-pad (all 4 directions) — real `+actionslot 1-4` dispatch, data-driven by
  loadout.
- Survival ready-up (hold Y ~740ms between waves) — the one deliberate exception to
  this mod's native-only approach (synthesizes a real F5 keypress; the real native
  trigger was never found despite an extensive search).
- Buy-station + pause interaction fix (a real native engine bug, not ours, that
  could permanently break all input until level reload).

Known limitations at this release: Back unassigned, killstreaks need per-killstreak
work, full menu/UI navigation not implemented, Multiplayer not started.
